                Hey, I'm Nicholas Yoon and welcome to my "About Me" page.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                I am 23 years old and a recent graduate from Georgia Southern University. I originally got into coding through my love of video games from a young 
                age but after learning about all of the different avenues available in the industry, I drifted more towards software development with an interest
                in security. I know that there is so much I have still yet to learn about when it comes to the different areas of expertise within the industry and
                I'm hoping to both learn and discover any areas I may find my passion in.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                When it comes to interests outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing games with friends, and competing in fencing. I've fenced for about
                9-10 years cumulatively and I still attend competitions when I can with my friends from university.
           </p>
        
           <p>
               As evident from the picture on the left, I also enjoy cooking, though I'm still very much a novice, and am often the one cooking during trips with friends (thus
                the origin of the picture). So far my list of dishes I can cook without blowing up the kitchen (most of the time) include:
           </p>
    
           <ul>
               <li>French Omelettes</li>
               <li>Salmon with Lemon Garlic Cream Sauce</li>
               <li>Béchamel Mac and Cheese</li>
               <li>Risotto</li>
           </ul>
