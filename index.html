        <p>
            Hey, I'm Nicholas Yoon and welcome to my "About Me" page.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I am 23 years old and a recent graduate from Georgia Southern University. I originally got into coding through my love of video games from a young 
            age but after learning about all of the different avenues available in the industry, I drifted more towards software development with an interest
            in security. I know that there is so much I have still yet to learn about when it comes to the different areas of expertise within the industry and
            I'm hoping to both learn and discover any areas I may find my passion in.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            When it comes to interests outside of coding, I enjoy listening to music, playing games with friends, and competing in fencing. I've fenced for about
            9-10 years cumulatively and I still attend competitions when I can with my friends from university.
       </p>
    
       <p>
           As evident from the picture on the left, I also enjoy cooking, though I'm still very much a novice, and am often the one cooking during trips with friends (thus
            the origin of the picture). So far my list of dishes I can cook without blowing up the kitchen (most of the time) include:
       </p>

       <ul>
           <li>French Omelettes</li>
           <li>Salmon with Lemon Garlic Cream Sauce</li>
           <li>BÃ©chamel Mac and Cheese</li>
           <li>Risotto</li>
       </ul>

        <p>I honestly can't think of what else to put as a list so here are my top 3 regrets in life:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Getting into League of Legends</li>
            <li>Not having a normal sleeping schedule</li>
            <li>Getting smacked with the short gene :(</li>
        </ol>
